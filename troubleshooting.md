If the add-on isn't working for you, try these steps

# The add-on isn't working/stopped working
This is for when you're suddenly back to new twitter or never got back to old twitter.
For other issues check known issues below or [submit a new issue](https://github.com/ZusorCode/GoodTwitter/issues).

First, try hard refreshing twitter. Shift+Click on [reload](https://i.imgur.com/Eai0GOG.png) in the twitter tab.

Next, try clearing cookies for twitter. Click on [info](https://i.imgur.com/6Tpv9gY.png),
then WAIT for the [clear cookies button](https://i.imgur.com/VwNMUpm.png) and click it. Now just click [remove](https://i.imgur.com/ZykdWVt.png).
You'll have to log back in. That should fix most issues.

If that still didn't work, try reinstalling goodtwitter by going to the [store page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodtwitter/),
clicking remove then installing it again.

One issue could also be Firefox not being updated. [Click on menu](https://i.imgur.com/kLqsDJD.png), [help](https://i.imgur.com/ADRNJuH.png),
then [about](https://i.imgur.com/DDl1lic.png), then make sure [firefox is up to date](https://i.imgur.com/B53WtWW.png).

If all that didn't work create an issue on GitHub [here](https://github.com/ZusorCode/GoodTwitter/issues)
